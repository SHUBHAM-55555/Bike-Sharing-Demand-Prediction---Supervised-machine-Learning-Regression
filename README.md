### **Introduction**
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.



### **Problem statement**
We are tasked with predicting the number of bikes rented each hour so as to make an approximate estimation of the number of bikes to be made available to the public given a particular hour of the day.



### **Overview of the data**
We are given the following columns in our data:

Date : year-month-day Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour Hour - Hour of the day Temperature-Temperature in Celsius Humidity - % Wind Speed - m/s Visibility - 10m Dew point temperature - Celsius Solar radiation - MJ/m2 Rainfall - mm Snowfall - cm Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn Holiday - Holiday/No holiday Functional Day - No(Non Functional Hours), Yes(Functional hours)

### **Steps involved**
Installing libraies and getting the dataset. Performing EDA (exploratory data analysis). Drawing conclusions from the data. Preprocessing the data. Training different models. Evaluating metrics of all the models.


### **Algorithms used**
Linear Regression Lasso And Ridge Regression Decision Tree Regressor Gradient Boosting

We used R2-score to understand which model fit our data better

### **Conclusion**
Demand for bikes got higher when the temperature and hour values were more.

Demand was high for low values of Humidity and solar radiation.

Demand was high during springs and summer and autumn and very low during winters.

Maximum bikes were reneted in the year 2018

Count of rented bikes is high during no holiday and functioning day especially during office time.
